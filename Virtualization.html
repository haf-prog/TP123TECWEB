  <h1>Virtualization</h1>
  <p>
    In computing,  <b > virtualization </b> refers to the act of creating a virtual <i> (rather than actual) </i >  version of somthing.
    <br>This includes virtual computer hardwer, virtual storage devices and virtual network resources.
  </p>
  <hr />
  <h1>Levels of Virtualization</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>virtualization at Inscruction Set Architecture (ISA) level</li>
    <p>
    Every machine has an instruction set. This instruction set an interface between software and hardware. Using this instructions software can communicate withe hardware.
    </p>
    <li>Virtualization at Operating System (O.S) level</li>
    <p>
    In virtualization at HAL level each virtual machine is built from scratch i.e.by installing O.S., application suites, networcking systems, etc.
    <ul>
      <li>In cloud sometimes, We need to initialize 100 virtual machines at a single time, if we use virtualization at Hardware abstraction layer (HAL) level this can tack too much time.</li>
      <li>So, to overcome this in Virtualization at Operating system level we share operating between Virtual machines along with the hardwer.</li>
    </ul>
